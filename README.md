This is a standalone utility written to process systemd-style systemusers.d
files so that they can be handled on systems with or without systemd
installed.

For more information on the files this utility can process, see the
sysusers.d man page [1].

For more information on the systemd-sysuser command, see the
systemd-sysuers man page [2].
